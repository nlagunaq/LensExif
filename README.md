# LensExif
A little application with GUI to add or modify lens and aperture exif data to raw files (.nef, .arw, .dng, etc.), useful for people people using manual lenses on digital cameras.

You can prewiew images:

# Install

It works on Linux, should work on windows and Mac OS X, but never tried.

For now you just download the code and execute 

> python (path-to-folder)/src/lens_exif_view.py

Later I will add an install file.
